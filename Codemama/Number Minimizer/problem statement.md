Number minimizer
Problem Statement

Given a string ###S representing a very large integer, minimize **S** by changing at most ###K digits, such that ###S still doesn't contain any leading zeros. Input length and output length should be same.
Input

Will contains a string ###S, and an integer ###K separated by spaces in a single line.
Output

Print "Min = " then print minimum number after the change(If any) of the string without leading zeros.
Constraints

     10≤∣S∣≤10010≤∣S∣≤100
     1≤K≤∣S∣1≤K≤∣S∣

Example 1:
Input:

9876543210 5

Output:

Min = 1000043210
