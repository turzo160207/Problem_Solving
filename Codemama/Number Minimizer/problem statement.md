# Number minimizer
# Problem Statement

# Given a string SS representing a very large integer, minimize SS by changing at most KK digits, such that SS still doesn't contain any leading zeros. Input length and output length should be same.
# Input

# Will contains a string SS, and an integer KK separated by spaces in a single line.
# Output

# Print "Min = " then print minimum number after the change(If any) of the string without leading zeros.
# Constraints

#     10≤∣S∣≤10010≤∣S∣≤100
#     1≤K≤∣S∣1≤K≤∣S∣

# Example 1:
# Input:

# 9876543210 5

# Output:

# Min = 1000043210
