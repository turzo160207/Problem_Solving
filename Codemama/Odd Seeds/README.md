Odd Seeds

Problem Statement

There are *N* fields numbering 1,2,...N1,2,...N. Each field grow a number of plants equal to their integer values. You are given two fields *A* and *B*, your task is to calculate the total number of plants in all fields that has odd number of plants between Field *A* and Field *B*.
Input

Two numbers, **A** and **B** will be seperated by space.
Output

A single integer, the sum of all plants in the fields yielding an odd number of plants between Field **A** and Field **B**.
Constraints

    1≤A,B≤1000

Example 1:

Input:

1 10

Output:

25

Example 2:

Input:

10 3

Output:

24

Notes:

In second example, the fields with an odd number of plants between field 10 and field 3 are fields 9, 7, 5, 3. The total number of plants in these fields is 9+7+5+3 = 24.
